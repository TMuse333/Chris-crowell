const description = `When I’m not helping clients with their real estate needs, you’ll find me living an active lifestyle. I’m a brown belt in jiu-jitsu, a passionate outdoorsman, and love hiking, running, and all things fitness. I’m also a family man, married to my beautiful wife, and we share our lives with our two dogs, Loki and Lu.

I believe in bringing the same discipline, focus, and energy from my fitness journey into my real estate career—always striving for excellence and making the experience enjoyable for my clients.`
